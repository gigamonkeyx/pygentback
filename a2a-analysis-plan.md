# IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

## PyGent Factory A2A Protocol Integration & Multi-Agent System Enhancement

### Project Overview
Based on the comprehensive A2A protocol research, create a systematic plan to understand and enhance PyGent Factory's multi-agent capabilities, focusing on A2A protocol implementation, agent orchestration, task management, and multi-agent communication systems.

### Research Foundation Summary
- **A2A Protocol**: Google's open standard for agent-to-agent communication using JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S)
- **Key Components**: Agent Cards, Task Management, Message Passing, Streaming (SSE), Push Notifications
- **Enterprise Features**: Authentication, Authorization, Security, Long-running tasks
- **Complementary to MCP**: A2A handles agent-to-agent communication while MCP handles tool/resource access
