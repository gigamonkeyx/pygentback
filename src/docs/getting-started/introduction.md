# Introduction to PyGent Factory

Welcome to PyGent Factory, a cutting-edge **MCP-compliant agent factory system** designed to make AI agent development accessible, reliable, and scalable. Whether you're a beginner exploring AI agents or an experienced developer building production systems, PyGent Factory provides the tools and architecture you need.

## What is PyGent Factory?

PyGent Factory is a comprehensive platform for creating, managing, and orchestrating AI agents. Built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, it provides a standardized, secure, and extensible foundation for agent-based applications.

### The Agent Lifecycle

1. **Request**: User sends a message through the web interface
2. **Routing**: The system determines which agent type is best suited for the task
3. **Processing**: The agent uses its specialized capabilities, tools, and knowledge
4. **Memory**: Conversation context is stored for future reference
5. **Response**: The agent returns a comprehensive answer
6. **Learning**: The system improves based on interactions and feedback

## Agent Types Explained

PyGent Factory includes several specialized agent types, each optimized for different use cases:

### 🤔 **Reasoning Agent**
Uses **Tree of Thought (ToT)** methodology for complex problem-solving and decision-making.

**Best for**: Strategic planning, complex analysis, multi-step problem solving
**Example**: "Analyze the pros and cons of different deployment strategies for a microservices architecture"

### 🔍 **Research Agent**
Integrates with academic databases and search engines for comprehensive research.

**Best for**: Academic research, fact-checking, literature reviews
**Example**: "Research the latest developments in quantum computing and summarize key findings"

### 💻 **Coding Agent**
Specialized for software development with support for 22+ programming languages.

**Best for**: Code generation, debugging, code review, technical documentation
**Example**: "Create a Python FastAPI application with authentication and database integration"

### 🔎 **Search Agent**
Uses advanced RAG techniques for intelligent information retrieval.

**Best for**: Knowledge base queries, document search, information synthesis
**Example**: "Find all documentation related to WebSocket implementation in our codebase"

### 🧬 **Evolution Agent**
Optimizes solutions using evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming.

**Best for**: Parameter optimization, algorithm improvement, solution refinement
**Example**: "Optimize the hyperparameters for our machine learning model"

### 💬 **General Agent**
Versatile agent for everyday conversations and general assistance.

**Best for**: General questions, casual conversation, simple tasks
**Example**: "Explain how neural networks work in simple terms"
