# PyGent Factory Examples

This directory contains example code, demonstrations, and sample implementations for the PyGent Factory project.

## Directory Structure

### `/agent_creation/`
Examples demonstrating how to create, configure, and deploy agents in the PyGent Factory system.

### `/validation_examples/`
Example validation scripts and demonstration code for testing system functionality.

### `/integration_demos/`
Demonstration scripts showing integration patterns, workflows, and system capabilities.

## Purpose

These examples serve multiple purposes:
1. **Documentation**: Show how to use PyGent Factory features
2. **Learning**: Help developers understand system capabilities
3. **Testing**: Provide working examples for validation
4. **Demonstration**: Showcase system functionality to clients and stakeholders

## Usage

Examples are designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Each example can run independently
- **Well-documented**: Clear comments and explanations
- **Production-ready**: Based on real implementations, not mock code
- **Educational**: Demonstrate best practices and patterns

## Running Examples

Most examples can be run directly:
```bash
python examples/agent_creation/agent_creation_examples.py
```

Some examples may require specific configuration or setup - check individual file documentation.

## Contributing

When adding new examples:
1. Place agent-related examples in `/agent_creation/`
2. Place validation examples in `/validation_examples/`
3. Place integration demos in `/integration_demos/`
4. Include clear documentation and comments
5. Ensure examples work with current system state
6. Follow existing code style and patterns
