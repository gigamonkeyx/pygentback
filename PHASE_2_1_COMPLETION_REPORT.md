## Validation Results

### ‚úÖ **Successful Tests**:
1. **Base Agent Augmentation Hooks**: 100% functional
   - Augmentation configuration properly loaded
   - Metrics tracking operational
   - Augmented generation pipeline functional

2. **Performance Simulation**: 100% successful

   - Success rate: 100%
   - Scalability demonstrated across multiple operations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked Tests** (Due to Dependencies):
1. **Code Retriever Functionality**: Architecture complete, blocked by transformers library
2. **RAG Augmenter Integration**: Core functionality implemented, blocked by dependencies
3. **Full Coding Agent Integration**: Enhanced methods implemented, blocked by import issues

## Dependency Issues Identified

### Primary Issue: Transformers Library Compatibility
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'is_torch_npu_available' from 'transformers'
```

**Root Cause**: Version incompatibility between sentence-transformers and transformers libraries

**Impact**: Prevents full validation of RAG components that depend on embedding services

**Resolution Required**: 
- Update transformers library to compatible version
- OR implement alternative embedding service without sentence-transformers dependency
- OR use mock embedding service for testing (already implemented in basic tests)

### Secondary Issue: Module Import Paths
```
No module named 'ai.reasoning.tot'
```

**Root Cause**: Import path inconsistencies in coding agent

**Impact**: Prevents full coding agent testing

**Resolution**: Update import paths or implement missing modules
