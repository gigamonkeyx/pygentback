To complete the application, you'll need to create additional files:

- views/Results.vue
- components/StatsCards.vue
- components/AgentList.vue
- components/TaskList.vue
- components/NavigationMenu.vue

Each component should include proper TypeScript interfaces for props and data validation. For a production-ready implementation, consider adding:
1. Vuex or Pinia for state management
2. Vue Content Security Policy (CSP) directives
3. API rate limiting and caching strategies
4. Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. Authentication flow integration
6. Role-based access control
7. Performance monitoring

The application should be styled using a modern CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material You, with consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes throughout all components.
