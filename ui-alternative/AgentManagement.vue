Creating a complete Vue.js component for PyGent Factory agent management can be quite large, so I'll provide you with the basic structure of such a component. This example assumes that agents are stored in data property as an array of objects. In real-world applications, these actions (create, edit, and delete) would likely involve making HTTP requests to your server.

```vue
<template>
  <div class="pygent-factory">
    <h1>PyGent Factory Agent Management</h1>
    
    <button @click="addAgent()">Add New Agent</button>
   
    <ul class="agent-list">
      <li v-for="(agent, index) in agents" :key="index">
        <div class="card">
          <h2 class="name">{{ agent.name }}</h2>
          <p class="status">Status: {{ agent.status }}</p>
          
          <button @click="editAgent(agent)">Edit Agent</button>
          <button @click="deleteAgent(index)">Delete Agent</button>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue';
export default {
  setup() {
    const agents = ref([{name: 'Agent1', status:'Active'}, {name: 'Agent2', status: 'Inactive'}]);
    
    function addAgent() {
      // Add logic to create new agent. In real-world applications, you would likely make a HTTP request here
    }
  
    function editAgent(agent) {
      // Add logic to edit the selected agent. You may also want to display some form for editing and handle submission of changes
    }
    
    function deleteAgent(index) {
      agents.value.splice(index, 1);
    }
  
    return { agents, addAgent, editAgent, deleteAgent };
  },
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.pygent-factory {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

.agent-list {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}

.card {
  width: calc(33% - 20px);
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  transition: 0.3s;
}

.card:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
</style>
```

This is a very basic example of how to start this project. It does not cover all your requirements, but it should give you an idea about how to structure and style a Vue 3 component. For more complex operations (like HTTP requests), you would likely need to use `async` functions and the `fetch` API or Axios for data fetching/modifying, and probably Vue Router for navigation.
