I have an idea. 
1. we need to process research data first by downloading the actual papers when possible and when not links and summaries can act as a accessable memory and should be saved if access is needded to build context in the next step.
2. Research context building will come from vector db and other ways to store data. we should discuss this part. We need to process the data so that we can use it. Analysie is and produce content that is honest and true to the source matierial. Hallusonations, fake bullshit kills the product.
3. Parse the needed data first. Generate summaries for all topics then primary sources. 
4. Validation.
5.Final document needs to be created as a pdf with all academic standards for formating.
