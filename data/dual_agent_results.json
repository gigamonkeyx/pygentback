      "response": "<think>\nWe are going to create a Binary Search Tree (BST) class with methods: insert, search, delete, and inorder_traversal.\n We'll also include an __init__ method to initialize the tree.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Define a Node class inside or outside? Let's define it as an inner class for clarity but we can do either.\n    However, since this is a BST, let's have each node with left, right, and value.\n\n 2. The insert method should add a new node to the tree in the correct position (left if less than root, right if greater).\n\n 3. The search method will traverse the tree starting from the root until it finds the value or reaches None.\n\n 4. The delete method is more complex. We have three cases:\n    - Node to be deleted has no children: remove the node and set parent's corresponding child pointer to None.\n    - Node to be deleted has one child: connect the parent with that child.\n    - Node to be deleted has two children: find the inorder successor (or predecessor) and swap it with the node, then delete.\n\n 5. We'll implement inorder_traversal which returns a list of values in sorted order (inorder).\n\n Let's design:\n\n We can have:\n   class BinarySearchTree:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.root = None\n\n        class Node:\n            def __init__(self, value):\n                self.value = value\n                self.left = None\n                self.right = None\n\n But note: the problem says to create a class called 'BinarySearchTree'. We can do it either way.\n\n Alternatively, we can define the node as an inner class or separate. Let's make it an inner class for encapsulation.\n\n However, let me think about efficiency and clean code:\n\n   - Using an inner class might be cleaner because each BST instance has its own Node definition.\n   - But if we want to share the Node class between different trees (if any) then making it a separate class is better.\n\n Since the problem doesn't specify multiple trees, I'll go with an inner class for simplicity and encapsulation.\n\n Let's write the methods:\n\n 1. insert(value):\n    We start from the root and traverse until we find the correct position to insert.\n\n 2. search(value):\n    Traverse starting at the root until we either find the value or reach a leaf (None).\n\n 3. delete(value):\n    This is tricky. We need to keep track of parent node during deletion because we might reassign it.\n    Steps:\n        - First, perform standard BST search to locate the node and its parent.\n        - If not found, return False? Or raise an error? Let's say if value doesn't exist, then delete fails.\n\n 4. inorder_traversal():\n    We can do a recursive traversal (left-root-right) or iterative using stack. Since we are building a BST, let's use recursion for simplicity.\n\n However, note that the problem says to make it clean and efficient. For large trees, recursion might hit limits but in practice, if the tree is balanced, depth is logarithmic. We'll do recursive inorder traversal.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n</think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) class with methods for inserting nodes, searching for values, deleting nodes, and performing an inorder traversal. The BST should be efficient and include proper error handling to manage edge cases such as duplicate insertions or non-existent deletions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Node Class**: Define a nested `Node` class within the `BinarySearchTree` class to represent each node in the tree. Each node will have attributes for its value, left child, and right child.\n2. **Insert Method**: The method starts at the root node and recursively traverses the tree to find the correct position where the new node should be inserted based on BST properties (left subtree contains smaller values, right subtree contains larger values).\n3. **Search Method**: This method checks if a given value exists in the tree by starting from the root and moving left or right according to BST rules until it finds the value or reaches a leaf node.\n4. **Delete Method**: The deletion process involves three cases:\n   - **Case 1**: Deleting a node with no children (set parent's corresponding child pointer to None).\n   - **Case 2**: Deleting a node with one child (replace the node with its child).\n   - **Case 3**: Deleting a node with two children (find the inorder successor, swap it with the node to delete, and then delete the duplicate node). This ensures the BST property is maintained.\n5. **Inorder Traversal Method**: Perform an inorder traversal recursively by visiting left subtree first, then the root, and finally the right subtree, collecting values in a list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass BinarySearchTree:\n    \"\"\"A binary search tree data structure that supports insertion, search, deletion, and inorder traversal.\"\"\"\n\n    class Node:\n        \"\"\"Represents each node in the binary search tree.\"\"\"\n        def __init__(self, value):\n            self.value = value\n            self.left = None\n            self.right = None\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = None\n\n    def insert(self, value):\n        \"\"\"\n        Insert a new value into the BST.\n        \n        Args:\n            value: The value to be inserted.\n            \n        Returns:\n            bool: True if insertion is successful (value not already present), False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not isinstance(value, int):\n            raise ValueError(\"Value must be an integer\")\n        self.root = self._insert(self.root, value)\n        return True\n\n    def _insert(self, node, value):\n        \"\"\"Helper method to recursively insert a new node.\"\"\"\n        if node is None:\n            return BinarySearchTree.Node(value)\n        \n        #
