# Dual-Driver Evolution Architecture for PyGent Factory

## Overview

This document outlines the critical architectural requirement that PyGent Factory's evolution system must be driven by **both usage patterns AND MCP tool availability**. This dual-driver approach ensures agents evolve not just based on how they're used, but also based on what tools become available to enhance their capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Usage Pattern Analyzer

```python
class UsagePatternAnalyzer:
    """Monitors and analyzes how agents are used in real-world scenarios"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.usage_database = UsageDatabase()
        self.performance_tracker = PerformanceTracker()
        self.user_feedback_collector = FeedbackCollector()
    
    def analyze_patterns(self) -> UsageInsights:
        """Analyze current usage patterns and identify improvement opportunities"""
        patterns = {
            'task_distribution': self._analyze_task_types(),
            'success_rates': self._calculate_success_rates(),
            'performance_bottlenecks': self._identify_bottlenecks(),
            'user_satisfaction': self._analyze_feedback(),
            'failure_patterns': self._analyze_failures()
        }
        
        return UsageInsights(
            needs_improvement=self._assess_improvement_needs(patterns),
            priority_areas=self._identify_priority_areas(patterns),
            success_patterns=self._extract_success_patterns(patterns)
        )
    
    def _analyze_task_types(self):
        """What types of tasks are agents being asked to perform?"""
        pass
    
    def _calculate_success_rates(self):
        """How often do agents succeed at different task types?"""
        pass
    
    def _identify_bottlenecks(self):
        """Where do agents struggle or perform slowly?"""
        pass
    
    def _analyze_feedback(self):
        """What do users say about agent performance?"""
        pass
```

### 2. MCP Tool Availability Monitor

```python
class MCPToolAvailabilityMonitor:
    """Monitors the MCP tool landscape for new capabilities and changes"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_registry = MCPServerRegistry()
        self.tool_capability_mapper = ToolCapabilityMapper()
        self.change_detector = ToolChangeDetector()
    
    def detect_changes(self) -> ToolChangeInsights:
        """Detect changes in MCP tool availability and capabilities"""
        current_tools = self.mcp_registry.get_all_servers()
        tool_changes = self.change_detector.detect_changes(current_tools)
        
        return ToolChangeInsights(
            new_servers=tool_changes.new_servers,
            updated_capabilities=tool_changes.updated_capabilities,
            removed_servers=tool_changes.removed_servers,
            capability_gaps=self._identify_capability_gaps(current_tools),
            integration_opportunities=self._find_integration_opportunities(current_tools)
        )
    
    def _identify_capability_gaps(self, current_tools):
        """What capabilities are missing that could help with current tasks?"""
        # Analyze usage patterns to identify what tools would be helpful
        pass
    
    def _find_integration_opportunities(self, current_tools):
        """Which existing tools could be better integrated into agent workflows?"""
        # Analyze underutilized tools and potential synergies
        pass
```

### 3. Agent Evolution Engine

```python
class AgentEvolutionEngine:
    """Evolves agents based on both usage patterns and tool availability"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_factory = AgentFactory()
        self.evolution_strategies = EvolutionStrategies()
        self.validation_framework = EvolutionValidationFramework()
        self.archive = AgentArchive()
    
    def evolve_agents(self, usage_data: UsageInsights, tool_data: ToolChangeInsights):
        """Main evolution method that considers both usage and tool data"""
        
        # Determine evolution priorities based on both drivers
        evolution_priorities = self._determine_priorities(usage_data, tool_data)
        
        for priority in evolution_priorities:
            if priority.type == "usage_driven":
                self._evolve_for_usage_pattern(priority)
            elif priority.type == "tool_driven":
                self._evolve_for_tool_integration(priority)
            elif priority.type == "combined":
                self._evolve_for_combined_optimization(priority)
    
    def _evolve_for_usage_pattern(self, priority):
        """Evolve agents to address usage pattern issues"""
        # Improve agents based on performance bottlenecks, failure patterns, etc.
        pass
    
    def _evolve_for_tool_integration(self, priority):
        """Evolve agents to utilize new or underutilized MCP tools"""
        # Modify agents to incorporate new tool capabilities
        pass
    
    def _evolve_for_combined_optimization(self, priority):
        """Evolve agents considering both usage and tool factors"""
        # Optimize agents for specific usage patterns using available tools
        pass
```

### 4. LLM Integration Layer

```python
class LLMIntegrationLayer:
    """Manages the dual LLM setup: Claude 4 (supervisor) + Ollama/DeepSeek R1 (workers)"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.claude_supervisor = Claude4Supervisor()
        self.ollama_workers = OllamaWorkerPool()
    
    def execute_evolution_decision(self, evolution_proposal):
        """Execute evolution with Claude 4 oversight"""
        
        # DeepSeek R1 generates evolution proposal
        proposal = self.ollama_workers.generate_evolution_proposal(evolution_proposal)
        
        # Claude 4 validates and oversees
        validation = self.claude_supervisor.validate_evolution(proposal)
        
        if validation.approved:
            return self._execute_supervised_evolution(proposal, validation)
        else:
            return self._handle_rejected_evolution(proposal, validation)
    
    def _execute_supervised_evolution(self, proposal, validation):
        """Execute evolution under Claude 4 supervision"""
        # DeepSeek R1 executes with Claude 4 monitoring
        pass
    
    def _handle_rejected_evolution(self, proposal, validation):
        """Handle cases where Claude 4 rejects DeepSeek R1's proposal"""
        # Log rejection reason, request revision, etc.
        pass
```

## Evolution Triggers

### Usage-Based Triggers
1. **Performance Degradation**: Agent success rates drop below threshold
2. **User Feedback**: Negative feedback patterns emerge
3. **Task Pattern Changes**: New types of tasks become common
4. **Bottleneck Detection**: System identifies performance constraints

### Tool-Based Triggers
1. **New MCP Server**: New capabilities become available
2. **Tool Updates**: Existing tools gain new features
3. **Underutilization**: Available tools aren't being used effectively
4. **Capability Gaps**: Missing tools for common task patterns

### Combined Triggers
1. **Optimization Opportunities**: Better tool usage could improve performance
2. **Workflow Enhancement**: New tools could streamline common workflows
3. **Capability Expansion**: Tool combinations could enable new agent abilities

## Conclusion

The dual-driver evolution architecture ensures PyGent Factory evolves intelligently based on both how it's used and what tools are available. This creates a system that not only improves based on user needs but also proactively enhances capabilities as the MCP ecosystem grows.

The combination of Claude 4 supervision with Ollama/DeepSeek R1 execution provides both safety and performance, ensuring evolution decisions are both intelligent and validated.
