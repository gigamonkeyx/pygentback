# Feature Registry System - Preventing "Forgotten Features"

## The Problem

The PyGent Factory project has experienced a critical issue where valuable features get "forgotten" and need to be constantly rediscovered. This happens because:

1. **Rapid Development**: Features are implemented quickly but not always documented
2. **Complex Architecture**: Multiple servers, configurations, and integrations make tracking difficult
3. **Manual Documentation**: Relying on developers to manually update docs leads to gaps
4. **Feature Sprawl**: Features exist across different codebases (Python, JavaScript, Cloudflare Workers)
5. **Context Switching**: Developers forget about implemented features when working on other parts

## The Solution: Automated Feature Registry System

We've implemented a comprehensive automated system that prevents features from being forgotten:

### üîç **Automated Discovery**
- Scans the entire codebase for features across all languages and frameworks
- Discovers API endpoints, MCP servers, UI components, database models, and more
- Runs automatically as part of the development workflow

### üìö **Living Documentation**
- Generates up-to-date documentation automatically
- Links features to their code, tests, and configuration
- Provides searchable feature inventory

### üîß **Development Integration**
- Git hooks that run feature discovery on commits
- API endpoints for real-time feature browsing
- Health monitoring and alerts for undocumented features

### üìä **Analytics & Insights**
- Tracks feature lifecycle and usage
- Identifies orphaned or stale features
- Provides recommendations for maintenance

## System Components

### 1. Core Feature Registry (`src/feature_registry/core.py`)
The main discovery engine that:
- Scans for different types of features
- Analyzes feature health and relationships
- Generates comprehensive reports

### 2. API Integration (`src/api/routes/features.py`)
Provides REST endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/features/` - List all features
- `GET /api/v1/features/by-type/{type}` - Filter by type
- `GET /api/v1/features/health` - Health analysis
- `POST /api/v1/features/discover` - Trigger discovery

### 3. Workflow Integration (`feature_workflow_integration.py`)
Development workflow commands:
- `python feature_workflow_integration.py pre-commit` - Pre-commit checks
- `python feature_workflow_integration.py post-commit` - Update registry
- `python feature_workflow_integration.py daily-audit` - Comprehensive audit

### 4. Git Hooks (`hooks/`)
Automated execution:
- **pre-commit**: Validates feature documentation before commits
- **post-commit**: Updates registry after successful commits

## Feature Types Discovered

The system automatically discovers:

- **API Endpoints** - FastAPI routes and handlers
- **MCP Servers** - Both local Python servers and Cloudflare Workers
- **UI Components** - React/TypeScript components
- **Database Models** - SQLAlchemy models and schemas
- **Configuration Files** - JSON, YAML, environment files
- **Utility Scripts** - Analysis and maintenance scripts
- **Documentation** - Markdown, README files
- **Test Suites** - Unit and integration tests

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install aiofiles
```

### 2. Setup Git Hooks
```bash
python setup_git_hooks.py
```

### 3. Run Initial Discovery
```bash
python -m src.feature_registry.core
```

### 4. Add to FastAPI (if not already integrated)
```python
from src.api.routes.features import setup_feature_registry_routes
setup_feature_registry_routes(app)
```

## Usage Examples

### Manual Feature Discovery
```bash
# Run comprehensive discovery
python -m src.feature_registry.core

# Run workflow checks
python feature_workflow_integration.py daily-audit
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Get all features
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/features/

# Get health analysis
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/features/health

# Search features
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/features/search?q=mcp&feature_type=mcp_server"
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

The system integrates seamlessly with your development process:

1. **Before Commit**: Checks for critical undocumented features
2. **After Commit**: Updates feature registry automatically  
3. **Daily**: Runs comprehensive audit and generates reports
4. **On Demand**: Manual discovery and analysis

## Preventing Feature Loss

### Automated Checks
- **Documentation Coverage**: Alerts when too many features lack documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Identifies features without tests
- **Stale Feature Detection**: Finds features that haven't been updated recently
- **Orphan Detection**: Locates features with no dependencies or references

### Recommendations Engine
The system provides actionable recommendations:
- Which features to document first (based on impact)
- Which features need tests
- Which features might be deprecated
- How to improve overall feature health

### Living Documentation
- Auto-generated feature inventory
- Always up-to-date with codebase
- Searchable and filterable
- Links to source code and configuration

## Configuration

### Feature Discovery Settings
Customize what gets discovered by modifying `src/feature_registry/core.py`:

```python
# Add new file patterns
config_patterns = [
    "*.json", "*.yaml", "*.yml", "*.toml", 
    "*.env*", "*.config.js", "*.config.ts"
]

# Add new directories to scan
doc_dirs = ["docs", "documentation", "README"]
```

### Health Check Thresholds
Adjust warning thresholds in `feature_workflow_integration.py`:

```python
# Adjust these thresholds based on your project needs
MAX_UNDOCUMENTED = 10  # Alert if more than 10 undocumented features
MAX_MISSING_TESTS = 5   # Alert if more than 5 features lack tests
STALE_DAYS = 90        # Consider features stale after 90 days
```

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **No More Lost Features**: Automatic discovery prevents forgetting
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members can see all features instantly
- **Better Code Reviews**: Feature impact is visible during reviews
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Easy to find and understand existing features

### For Project Management
- **Feature Inventory**: Complete visibility into what's been built
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Identifies unmaintained features
- **Documentation Coverage**: Measures and improves documentation quality
- **Development Velocity**: Reduces time spent rediscovering features

### For Maintenance
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of feature quality
- **Deprecation Planning**: Data-driven decisions about feature lifecycle
- **Test Coverage**: Ensures critical features are tested
- **Dependency Tracking**: Understands feature relationships

## Monitoring and Alerts

The system provides several ways to monitor feature health:

### Daily Audit Reports
Automated daily reports showing:
- New features discovered
- Documentation coverage changes
- Test coverage improvements
- Feature health trends

### Pre-commit Validation
Before each commit, the system:
- Checks for critical undocumented features
- Validates that important features have tests
- Provides warnings and recommendations

### API Monitoring
Real-time access to:
- Current feature count and breakdown
- Health analysis and recommendations
- Search and filtering capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install aiofiles fastapi
```

**Permission Errors**: On Unix systems, ensure git hooks are executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Discovery Failures**: Check that the script can read all project directories:
```bash
# Test discovery manually
python -c "from src.feature_registry.core import FeatureRegistry; import asyncio; registry = FeatureRegistry('.'); asyncio.run(registry.discover_all_features())"
```

### Debugging Discovery

Enable debug logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- **Visual Dashboard**: Web UI for browsing features
- **Integration Testing**: Automated validation of feature interactions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track feature usage and performance
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Smart recommendations for feature improvements
- **Cross-Project Discovery**: Feature sharing across multiple projects

## Contributing

To extend the feature discovery system:
