- ‚úÖ UUID-based session management
- ‚úÖ Multi-language support

### Research Phases
- ‚úÖ All 8 research phases properly defined
- ‚úÖ Phase progression tracking
- ‚úÖ Status management

### Output Management
- ‚úÖ 8 output format types available
- ‚úÖ Quality assessment structure
- ‚úÖ Citation management

## üîß Integration Requirements

### Dependencies Met
- ‚úÖ FAISS for vector storage
- ‚úÖ BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping
- ‚úÖ Requests for HTTP operations
- ‚úÖ All existing PyGent Factory dependencies

### Integration Points
