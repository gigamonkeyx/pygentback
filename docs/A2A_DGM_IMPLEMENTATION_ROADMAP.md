# A2A + DGM Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document provides the high-level implementation roadmap for integrating Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol with Darwin GÃ¶del Machine (DGM) principles into PyGent Factory. The plan leverages existing infrastructure while introducing revolutionary self-improving agent capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure âœ…

PyGent Factory already has significant foundation components:

1. **Agent Factory & Registry** - `src/core/agent_factory.py`, `src/orchestration/agent_registry.py`
2. **Evolutionary Orchestration** - `src/orchestration/evolutionary_orchestrator.py`
3. **Collaborative Self-Improvement** - `src/orchestration/collaborative_self_improvement.py`
4. **A2A Integration (Partial)** - A2A server infrastructure exists
5. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - `src/ai/multi_agent/agents/`
6. **MCP Integration** - Full Model Context Protocol support
7. **Real-time WebSocket Communication** - Production-ready infrastructure

### Gaps to Address ðŸ”§

1. **Complete A2A Protocol Compliance** - Full spec implementation
2. **DGM Core Engine** - Self-code-modification capabilities
3. **Agent Card Generation** - Dynamic capability advertisement
4. **Distributed Agent Discovery** - Cross-network agent federation
5. **Empirical Validation Framework** - Performance-based improvement validation
