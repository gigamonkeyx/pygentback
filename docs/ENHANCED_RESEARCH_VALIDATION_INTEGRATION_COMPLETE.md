## Technical Integration Details

### Enhanced Source Validation Workflow
```python
# Traditional validation
validation_results = await self.source_validator.validate_historical_source(source)

# Enhanced cross-platform validation
cross_platform_results = await self.cross_platform_validator.validate_source_across_platforms(source)

# HathiTrust integration
hathitrust_results = await self.hathitrust_integration.search_by_title(source.title)

# Combined scoring with platform weighting
combined_score = validation_results.get("overall_credibility", 0.0)
if cross_platform_results.get("found_in_platforms", 0) > 1:
    combined_score = min(1.0, combined_score * 1.2)  # Multi-platform boost
if hathitrust_results and hathitrust_results.get("total_results", 0) > 0:
    combined_score = min(1.0, combined_score * 1.1)  # HathiTrust boost
```

### Enhanced Metadata Structure
Sources now include comprehensive validation metadata:
```python
source.metadata = {
    "cross_platform_validation": {
        "found_in_platforms": 3,
        "platforms_checked": ["hathitrust", "internet_archive", "loc"],
        "highest_credibility": 0.9
    },
    "hathitrust_results": {
        "total_results": 5,
        "verified_items": 3,
        "institutional_authority": True
    },
    "enhanced_validation": True
}
```

# Create historical research agent with enhanced validation
agent = HistoricalResearchAgent(config)

# Conduct research with integrated validation
query = ResearchQuery(topic="French Revolution")
sources = await agent._gather_historical_sources(query)  # Includes HathiTrust
validated_sources = await agent._validate_sources(sources)  # Multi-platform validation

# Each source now has enhanced metadata
for source in validated_sources:
    print(f"Credibility: {source.credibility_score}")
    print(f"Platforms validated: {source.metadata['cross_platform_validation']['found_in_platforms']}")
    print(f"HathiTrust verified: {source.metadata['hathitrust_results']['verified_items']}")
```

### Direct Cross-Platform Validation
```python
# Use validator directly
validator = CrossPlatformValidator()
validation_result = await validator.validate_single_source(source)

print(f"Overall credibility: {validation_result.overall_credibility}")
print(f"Platform consensus: {validation_result.consensus_score}")
print(f"Recommendation: {validation_result.recommendation}")
```
