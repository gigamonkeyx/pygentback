# DGM Architecture and Self-Improvement Loop

## DGM Core Principles

Darwin GÃ¶del Machine implements self-improving agents based on:

1. **Code Self-Modification**: Agents can modify their own code
2. **Empirical Validation**: Changes must improve measurable performance
3. **Archive System**: All improvements are stored and tracked
4. **Safety Constraints**: Modifications must pass safety checks

## Self-Improvement Loop

```python
async def dgm_improvement_cycle():
    """Core DGM improvement loop"""
    
    # 1. Performance Assessment
    current_performance = await measure_performance()
    
    # 2. Generate Improvement Hypothesis
    improvement_candidate = await generate_code_improvement()
    
    # 3. Safe Testing
    test_results = await validate_improvement(improvement_candidate)
    
    # 4. Empirical Validation
    if test_results.performance > current_performance:
        await apply_improvement(improvement_candidate)
        await archive_improvement(improvement_candidate, test_results)
    
    # 5. Continue Loop
    await schedule_next_cycle()
```

## Architecture Components

### Code Generator
- Generates safe code modifications
- Uses templates and patterns
- Validates syntax and safety

### Empirical Validator
- Runs performance benchmarks
- Compares before/after metrics
- Ensures improvements are measurable

### Archive System
- Stores all improvement attempts
- Tracks performance history
- Enables rollback capabilities

### Safety Monitor
- Prevents dangerous modifications
- Validates code before execution
- Monitors runtime behavior

## Integration with PyGent Factory

DGM integrates with existing PyGent Factory components:

- **Agent Factory**: Creates DGM-enabled agents
- **Evolutionary Orchestrator**: Coordinates multi-agent evolution
- **Performance Monitor**: Provides metrics for validation
- **A2A Protocol**: Enables inter-agent improvement sharing

## Safety Considerations

1. **Sandboxed Execution**: All modifications run in isolation
2. **Rollback Mechanisms**: Quick recovery from failed improvements
3. **Human Oversight**: Critical changes require approval
4. **Performance Bounds**: Limits on modification scope
5. **Code Review**: Generated code is validated before execution
