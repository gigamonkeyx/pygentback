# Integration Roadmap and Implementation Strategy

## Three-Phase Integration Plan

### Phase 1: A2A Protocol Foundation (4-6 weeks)
- Core A2A Protocol v0.2.1 implementation
- Agent Card system for capability advertisement
- Security and authentication framework
- Basic agent-to-agent communication

### Phase 2: DGM Self-Improvement Engine (6-8 weeks)
- DGM core engine implementation
- Code generation and validation system
- Empirical performance validation
- Archive system for improvement tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration (8-10 weeks)
- Distributed agent discovery and federation
- Cross-agent improvement sharing via A2A
- Advanced streaming and real-time capabilities
- Production deployment and monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Development
- Build and test each component independently
- Integrate gradually with existing infrastructure
