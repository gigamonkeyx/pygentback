## TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Critical Issues Resolved

1. **Method Name Mismatches**
   - Fixed `search_by_title` → `enhanced_historical_search`
   - Fixed `search_by_author` → `enhanced_historical_search` with author query
   - Removed references to non-existent `search_by_date_range` method

2. **ResearchQuery Constructor Issues**
   - Fixed `geographic_scope` parameter (moved to metadata)
   - Corrected parameter usage to match actual class definition
   - Proper query construction for HathiTrust searches

3. **Data Type Handling**
   - Fixed HathiTrust results handling (List vs Dict confusion)
   - Proper conversion of validation results to expected formats
   - Correct cross-platform validation result processing

4. **Import and Integration Issues**
   - Resolved circular import issues with proper module organization
   - Fixed method call signatures and parameter passing
   - Ensured proper initialization of all components
