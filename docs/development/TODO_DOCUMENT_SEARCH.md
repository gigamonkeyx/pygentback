# TODO: Document Search Enhancement

## Current Status
- Basic search working for titles, categories, paths
- Content search implementation attempted but has issues
- Getting zero results for searches like "learning"

## Issues to Investigate Later
1. Backend API endpoints may not be responding correctly
2. AbortSignal.timeout compatibility issues
3. Search filtering logic may be too restrictive
4. File loading and content extraction needs debugging

## Next Steps (Future)
1. Debug backend connectivity for search endpoints
2. Simplify content search implementation
3. Add better error handling and logging
4. Test with actual document content
