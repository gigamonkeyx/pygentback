await orchestration_manager.build_documentation(production=False)
```

### 2. Update Frontend Package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run build:docs && vite build",
    "build:docs": "node -e \"require('./orchestration-client').buildDocumentation()\"",
    "dev:docs": "node -e \"require('./orchestration-client').startDevMode()\""
  }
}
```

### 3. Create Orchestration Client

# Test documentation orchestrator
from src.orchestration import OrchestrationManager, DocumentationWorkflowType

manager = OrchestrationManager()
await manager.start()

# Build documentation
workflow_id = await manager.build_documentation(production=False)
status = await manager.get_documentation_status()
print(f"Documentation Status: {status}")

# Start development mode
dev_workflow_id = await manager.start_documentation_dev_mode()
workflows = await manager.list_documentation_workflows()
print(f"Active Workflows: {len(workflows)}")

# Health check
health = await manager.check_documentation_health()
print(f"Health Status: {health['overall_health']}")
```

### Test Conflict Resolution
```python
# Test conflict resolver
from src.orchestration.conflict_resolver import ConflictResolver
from src.orchestration.documentation_models import DocumentationConfig

config = DocumentationConfig()
resolver = ConflictResolver(config, event_bus)

conflicts = await resolver.detect_conflicts()
print(f"Conflicts Found: {len(conflicts)}")

if conflicts:
    result = await resolver.resolve_conflicts(task)
    print(f"Conflicts Resolved: {result.success}")
```
